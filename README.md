# Vimdeck [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vimdeck.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/vimdeck)

VIM as a presentation tool


## News

Vimdeck now uses [redcarpet](http://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) to parse and render markdown!

I've cleaned up the code significantly. So those of you who like more features in Vimdeck
can fork and pull-request your buns off.


## Installation

Install a markdown syntax highlighting plugin for VIM. (I recommend [tpope/vim-markdown](http://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown))

Install the VIM plugin [SyntaxRange](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SyntaxRange).

```
gem install vimdeck
```

If you have problems getting RMagick to install, try installing [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) explicitly first. You may also need [MagickWand](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php) and Ruby Development tools (libmagickwand-dev and ruby-dev respectively on Ubuntu).


## Usage

1. Write your slides in a markdown file (See below for details on _limited_ markdown syntax)

2. Run `vimdeck <file_name.md>` and it will generate a file for each slide and open them in VIM


## Docker

It is also possible to run vimdeck via Docker image.

Run `docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/slides malikoth/vimdeck <file_name.md>


## VIM Script

Vimdeck will also provide a script file that will set up keybindings for you.

- PageUp/Left go backwards
- PageDown/Right go forward
- Q closes presentation


## A Note about VIM

This is a tool meant for VIM users. In other words, it is not a VIM plugin
&mdash; it's a script that converts a plain text document into multiple files.

The only hard dependency is [SyntaxRange](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SyntaxRange).

Other than that you may need some syntax highlighting plugins to handle the code syntax highlighting. [vim-scripts/ingo-library](https://github.com/vim-scripts/ingo-library) may be required for syntax highlighting.


## A Note About Markdown

Slides are separated by 2 newlines in a row.

Example:

```
# Slide 1

- has some
- really important
- information


# Slide 2

Is less important
```

Vimdeck uses redcarpet to parse its markdown and implements a custom renderer
for things like ascii art. It uses a very small subset of markdown. List of items supported:

- h1s
- h2s
- images
- fenced code blocks

That's it. The point of Markdown is that it's human-readable. Other stuff like (un)ordered
lists, block quotes, indented code blocks, etc. will be displayed just as they were written.

Fenced code blocks look like this:

    ```javascript
       this.is = 'code'
    ```

## Highlighting Syntax

Vimdeck also supports "highlighting" parts of a slide. This is an experimental feature and needs more testing.

Use `{~ unimportant_text_here ~}` to "unhighlight" portions of a slide:

    # Slide Title

    {~- Unimportant bullet~}
    - Important bullet
    {~- Really unimportant bullet~}

This allows you to create multiple versions of the same slide but with different parts highlighted.
Which is something I like to use often when presenting code snippets.

## Why Ruby?

Additionally, I want to point out that I realize that it's odd to have a VIM-based tool
and not write it as a VIM script. Ruby was my language of choice only because the ascii art dependencies
were implemented as ruby gems. Plus, I &hearts; ruby.

Images are even converted to ascii art!
